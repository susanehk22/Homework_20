    <img src="images/Hero_for_Bootstrap.svg" alt="website hero image" class="heroImage">
    <p class="lead">In 2021 it might surprise you that approximately 19 million Americans—6 percent of the population—still lack access to fixed broadband service at threshold speeds. This is also known as the Digital Divide, which has been exposed even more by COVID, deepening the economic inequality of our communities. EveryoneOn is a non-profit organization that has stepped in to close our nation’s Digital Divide. As it was, the current website lacked trustworthiness due to its confusing information architecture and poor quality media.</p>
    <p>As one of the designers in a team of 4, I set out to resolve these issues so that users could trust everyoneon.org and make individual donations, and be encouraged to spread the word in their communities. Our goal is to increase individual donations from the organizations current 1.65% to 3%. This design sprint spanned 1 week to create and apply our design changes.</p>

          With 3 fellow UX designers, I conducted six (6) user interviews and one (1) online survey to confirm if users would trust donating to the original site, and if they were able to navigate through the site with ease.

          I quickly found that our users require a reliable platform to donate to non-profits, that they need to believe in an organization’s cause, and that they should be able to see what their money is doing.

    <h2>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
    <img src="images/Lofi_Protos.svg" alt="low fidelity paper wireframes" class="heroImage">
    <p class="lead">One of my main focuses was to consolidate the donation process in as few screens as possible. I also felt there should be celebration for the user after making their donation to reinforce their good deed and to encourage them to potentially make another donation in the future. This is why I added the idea for an animation as the last screen of the donation process.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>We’ve established that trust is a major factor when donating to a non-profit’s website. After some digging, we found that EveryoneOn has been working with local governement under the Obama Administration since 2015. 

      I believed this should be featured on the main page to immediately reassure our users that this is a legitimate organization.</p>
